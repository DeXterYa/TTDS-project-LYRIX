1,Taylor Swift,22,"[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
22 (I don't know about you)
22, 22

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22 (Whoa, oh)
22 (Dancing like)
22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you"
2,Taylor Swift,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30,"According to my birth certificate, I turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are ""the most fun!"" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring.

Lesson 1

I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren‚Äôt, how you‚Äôre failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I‚Äôm showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I‚Äôm training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look üî•üî•üî•. I‚Äôm also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to ‚Äúgo die in a hole ho‚Äù while I‚Äôm having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it‚Äôs healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once.

Lesson 2

Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life‚Äôs worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake‚Äîonly bite if someone steps on you.

Lesson 3

Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it‚Äôs good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It‚Äôs especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That‚Äôs GOOD. We‚Äôll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That‚Äôs not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you‚Äôll learn from it. Then you‚Äôll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it‚Äôs fine; do you, you‚Äôre searching.

Lesson 4

I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.

Lesson 5

Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn‚Äôt cruel. It‚Äôs just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it.

Lesson 6

I‚Äôve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren‚Äôt allowed to age. It‚Äôs an impossible standard to meet, and I‚Äôve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we‚Äôre supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn‚Äôt even remotely required of men.

Lesson 7

My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn‚Äôt know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I‚Äôve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I‚Äôve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.

Lesson 8

I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was ‚Äúcouples goals‚Äù based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn‚Äôt real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.

Lesson 9

I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm‚Äôs cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because‚Ä¶2016.

Lesson 10

I‚Äôve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I‚Äôll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten‚Äôs Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson‚Äôs Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver‚Äôs Chicken Fajitas with Mol√© Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I‚Äôm pretty sure the internet would call a ‚Äúweird flex.‚Äù)

Lesson 11

Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I‚Äôd hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape.

Lesson 12

Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it‚Äôs so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but...‚Äù and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.

Lesson 13

It‚Äôs my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying ‚ÄúThis happened to me.‚Äù It‚Äôs something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don‚Äôt.

Lesson 14

When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you‚Äôve never dealt with before, it‚Äôs okay to say that you don‚Äôt know what to say. Sometimes just saying you‚Äôre so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It‚Äôs okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don‚Äôt have all the answers. However, it‚Äôs not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they‚Äôre at their lowest point. Even if you can‚Äôt really help the situation, it‚Äôs nice for them to know that you would if you could.

Lesson 15

Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.

Lesson 16

Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don‚Äôt know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn‚Äôt gold, and first impressions actually aren‚Äôt everything. It‚Äôs impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a ‚Äúsolid first 15‚Äù), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they‚Äôve seen you broken? Or after they‚Äôve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they‚Äôre people? These are things a first impression could never convey.

Lesson 17

After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can‚Äôt I be soft during all the seasons?!

Lesson 18

Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It‚Äôs important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.

Lesson 19

Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you‚Äôre shooting yourself in the foot if you don‚Äôt tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.

Lesson 20

Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in our young twenties!‚Äù hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they‚Äôll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It‚Äôs sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you‚Äôll always keep the memories.

Lesson 21

Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don‚Äôt look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.

Lesson 22

How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you‚Äôre not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren‚Äôt trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there‚Äôs a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who ‚Äúwon‚Äù the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say ‚ÄúHey, same team.‚Äù Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don‚Äôt give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.

Lesson 23

I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they‚Äôre here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I‚Äôll never forget the ones who stuck around.

Lesson 24

I‚Äôve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It‚Äôs taught me that there are real problems and then there‚Äôs everything else. My mom‚Äôs cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.

Lesson 25

I remember people asking me, ‚ÄúWhat are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?‚Äù There‚Äôs a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I‚Äôm really grateful to have learned this isn‚Äôt true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.

Lesson 26

I make countdowns for things I‚Äôm excited about. When I‚Äôve gone through dark, low times, I‚Äôve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they‚Äôre free) and adding things I‚Äôm looking forward to. Even if they‚Äôre not big holidays or anything, it‚Äôs good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it‚Äôs good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.

Lesson 27

I learned that disarming someone‚Äôs petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I‚Äôve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I‚Äôve ever felt in my life, but I can‚Äôt tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It‚Äôs the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll‚Äôs hateful Instagram comment with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I‚Äôll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.

Lesson 28

I‚Äôm finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I‚Äôm going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.

Lesson 29

I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It‚Äôs the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they‚Äôve left me. Please pray for their safe return.

Lesson 30

My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I‚Äôd lock myself in my room and couldn‚Äôt forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I‚Äôve made a mistake, whether it‚Äôs self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I‚Äôve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go."
3,Taylor Swift,Acting Like a Boy*,
4,Taylor Swift,Afterglow,"[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you‚ÄÖdidn‚Äôt‚ÄÖdo
I pinned your‚ÄÖhands behind your back, oh
Thought I‚ÄÖhad reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there‚Äôs no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don‚Äôt wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don‚Äôt wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it‚Äôs all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It‚Äôs on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow"
5,Taylor Swift,Ain‚Äôt Nothing ‚ÄôBout You,"[Intro]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren‚Äôt nothing about you that don't do something for me

[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren‚Äôt nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren‚Äôt nothing about you (there aren‚Äôt nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren‚Äôt nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren‚Äôt nothing about you (there aren‚Äôt nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren‚Äôt nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren‚Äôt nothing about you (there aren‚Äôt nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

[Chorus - Modified]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive

[Outro]
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren‚Äôt nothing about you that don't do something for me"
6,Taylor Swift,Album of the Year Acceptance Speech (Grammys 2016),"I want to thank the fans for the last 10 years, and the recording academy for giving us this unbelievable honor. I want to thank all of the collaborators that you see on this stage. Mostly, I want to thank my co-executive producer Max Martin, who has deserved to be up here for 25 years. And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammy's twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you will know it was you and the people who love you who put you there,  and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment."
7,Taylor Swift,All Night Diner,"[Verse 1]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again
Tell myself 'I must be crazy'
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

[Chorus]
I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Verse 2]
I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Bridge]
There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
'Nd baby without you -

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Outro]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now"
8,Taylor Swift,All of the Girls,"[Lyrics from Taylor's Inner Circle]
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine"
9,Taylor Swift,All Too Well,"[Intro]
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus 2]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
